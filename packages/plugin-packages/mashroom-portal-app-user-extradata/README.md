# Mashroom Portal App User ExtraData

Plugin for [Mashroom Server](https://www.mashroom-server.com), a **Microfrontend Integration Platform**.

This [Mashroom Portal](../mashroom-portal) plugin copies the property *extraData* from the server user object to the *Portal App* user.
This is useful if the security provider adds some extra information (such as the phone number) and you want to use it in a Portal App.

## Usage

If *node_modules/@mashroom* is configured as a plugin path, add **@mashroom/mashroom-portal-app-user-extradata** as *dependency*.
