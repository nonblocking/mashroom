# Mashroom Portal App User ExtraData

Plugin for [Mashroom Server](https://www.mashroom-server.com), a **Microfrontend Integration Platform**.

This plugin copies the property *extraData" from the server user object to the Portal App user.
This is useful if the security provider adds some extra information (such as the phone number) and you want to use it in a Portal App.

## Usage

If *node_modules/@mashroom* is configured as plugin path just add **@mashroom/mashroom-portal-enhancement-legacy-browser** as *dependency*.
