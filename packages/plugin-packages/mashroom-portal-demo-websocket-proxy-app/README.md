# Mashroom Portal Demo WebSocket Proxy App

Plugin for [Mashroom Server](https://www.mashroom-server.com), a **Integration Platform for Microfrontends**.

Adds a demo App (Microfrontend) to the _Mashroom Portal_ that demonstrates how the Portal can proxy a WebSocket
server that cannot be reached directly by the client.

## Usage

If *node_modules/@mashroom* is configured as plugin path just add **@mashroom/mashroom-portal-demo-rest-proxy-app** as *dependency*.

Then you can place it on any page via Portal Admin Toolbar.
