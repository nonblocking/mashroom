# Mashroom Portal Demo React App 2

Plugin for [Mashroom Server](https://www.mashroom-server.com), a **Integration Platform for Microfrontends**.

This is another simple [React](https://reactjs.org) based SPA which can be developed and run standalone, but can also
act as a building block in the _Mashroom Portal_.

This SPA also supports server side rendering and demonstrates how a custom editor can be used
for the Portal App configuration (instead of the default JSON editor).

## Usage

If *node_modules/@mashroom* is configured as plugin path just add **@mashroom/mashroom-portal-demo-react-app** as *dependency*.

Then you can place it on any page via Portal Admin Toolbar.
