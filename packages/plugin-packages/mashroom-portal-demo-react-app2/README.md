# Mashroom Portal Demo React App 2

Plugin for [Mashroom Server](https://www.mashroom-server.com), a **Microfrontend Integration Platform**.

This is another simple [React](https://reactjs.org) based Portal App that can be developed and run standalone, but can also
act as a building block in the [Mashroom Portal](../mashroom-portal).

This Portal App also supports server-side rendering and demonstrates how a custom editor can be used
for the Portal App configuration (instead of the default JSON editor).

## Usage

If *node_modules/@mashroom* is configured as a plugin path, add **@mashroom/mashroom-portal-demo-react-app2** as *dependency*.

Then you can place it on any page via *Portal Admin Toolbar*.
