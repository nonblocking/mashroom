# Mashroom Portal Demo React App

Plugin for [Mashroom Server](https://www.mashroom-server.com), a **Integration Platform for Microfrontends**.

This is a simple [React](https://reactjs.org) based SPA which can be developed and run standalone, but can also
act as a building block in the _Mashroom Portal_.

## Usage

If *node_modules/@mashroom* is configured as plugin path just add **@mashroom/mashroom-portal-demo-react-app** as *dependency*.

Then you can place it on any page via Portal Admin Toolbar.
