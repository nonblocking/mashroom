# Mashroom Portal Demo SolidJS App

Plugin for [Mashroom Server](https://www.mashroom-server.com), a **Microfrontend Integration Platform**.

This is a simple [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com) based SPA which can be developed and run standalone, but can also
act as a building block in the _Mashroom Portal_.

## Usage

If *node_modules/@mashroom* is configured as plugin path just add **@mashroom/mashroom-portal-demo-solidjs-app** as *dependency*.

Then you can place it on any page via Portal Admin Toolbar.
