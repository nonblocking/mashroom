# Mashroom Documentation

Plugin for [Mashroom Server](https://www.mashroom-server.com), a **Microfrontend Integration Platform**.

This plugin contains the Mashroom documentation. It will be generated from the markup file in the /docs folder and
the README files of the plugins.

This plugin also integrates into the Admin UI and makes the documentation available under _/mashroom/admin/ext/documentation_.
