# Mashroom Portal Demo Load Dynamically App

Plugin for [Mashroom Server](https://www.mashroom-server.com), a **Integration Platform for Microfrontends**.

This is a simple SPA that demonstrates how an App registered to the _Mashroom Portal_ can load and unload other Portal Apps
on a page with a specific config.

## Usage

If *node_modules/@mashroom* is configured as plugin path just add **@mashroom/mashroom-portal-demo-load-dynamically-app** as *dependency*.

Then you can place it on any page via Portal Admin Toolbar.
