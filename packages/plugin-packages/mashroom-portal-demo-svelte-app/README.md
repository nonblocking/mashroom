# Mashroom Portal Demo Svelte App

Plugin for [Mashroom Server](https://www.mashroom-server.com), a **Microfrontend Integration Platform**.

This is a simple [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) based Microfrontend that can be developed and run standalone, but can also
act as a building block in the [Mashroom Portal](../mashroom-portal).

It also demonstrates how SSR support can be added.

## Usage

If *node_modules/@mashroom* is configured as a plugin path, add **@mashroom/mashroom-portal-demo-svelte-app** as *dependency*.

Then you can place *Mashroom Portal Demo Svelte App* on any page via *Portal Admin Toolbar*.
