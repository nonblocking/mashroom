# Mashroom Portal Demo Angular App

Plugin for [Mashroom Server](https://www.mashroom-server.com), a **Integration Platform for Microfrontends**.

This is a simple [Angular](https://angular.io) based SPA which can be developed and run standalone, but can also
act as a building block in the _Mashroom Portal_.

## Usage

If *node_modules/@mashroom* is configured as plugin path just add **@mashroom/mashroom-portal-demo-angular-app** as *dependency*.

Then you can place it on any page via Portal Admin Toolbar.

## Implementation hints

Angular was clearly designed for monolithic web applications that use the whole browser window. So, to make it more behave
like a *Microfrontend* you have to change a few things in the template generated by the Angular CLI:

 * Since you can register a *NgModule* only once use a dummy main module that loads the actual app module (see *loader.module.ts*),
   otherwise you could not load the App multiple times with different configurations on the same page
 * Remove all polyfills, since *Microfrontends* should not install global libraries
 * Get rid of *zone.js* because it installs itself globally and interferes with other Apps as well
