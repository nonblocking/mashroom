# Mashroom Portal Demo Angular App

Plugin for [Mashroom Server](https://www.mashroom-server.com), a **Microfrontend Integration Platform**.

This is a simple [Angular](https://angular.io) based Microfrontend that can be developed and run standalone, but can also
act as a building block in the [Mashroom Portal](../mashroom-portal).

## Usage

If *node_modules/@mashroom* is configured as a plugin path, add **@mashroom/mashroom-portal-demo-angular-app** as *dependency*.

Then you can place it on any page via *Portal Admin Toolbar*.

## Implementation hints

Angular was clearly designed for monolithic web applications that use the whole browser window. So, to make it more behave
like a *Microfrontend* you have to change a few things in the template generated by the Angular CLI:

 * Since you can register a *NgModule* only once, use a dummy main module that loads the actual app module (see *loader.module.ts*);
   otherwise you could not load the App multiple times with different configurations on the same page
 * Remove all polyfills, since *Microfrontends* should not install global libraries
 * Get rid of *zone.js* because it installs itself globally and might infer with other Apps
