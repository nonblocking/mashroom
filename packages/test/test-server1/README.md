# Test Server

A simple test server that runs in dev mode (re-compiles and reloads after code changes) and doesn't require any external services.

It automatically adds all plugins from https://github.com/nonblocking/mashroom-plugin-demos if it is cloned into
a folder *mashroom-plugin-demos* on the same level than *mashroom*.

## Start
