If you are interested in making *Mashroom Server* better, you can submit a pull request.

To setup a development environment Node.js >= 20 is required.

After cloning the repository run

    npm run setup

to install all dependencies and build the core packages.

And check out one of the test servers in *packages/test* as a starting point:

    cd packages/test/test-server1
    npm start

The test server will be available at http://localhost:5050
